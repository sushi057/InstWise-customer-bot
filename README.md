# Langgraph Chatbot Project

This project implements a chatbot using the Langgraph library. The chatbot interacts with users, processes their inputs, and provides responses based on predefined nodes and edges in a state graph.

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```sh
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a [`.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fsushi%2FCode%2FInstWise%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/sushi/Code/InstWise/.env") file and add necessary environment variables.
